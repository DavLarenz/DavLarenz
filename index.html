        <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Project 1: Portfolio Website</h3>
                <p>I have a number of skills which are still in working progress. One of them is a personal portfolio website, to showcase my work and skills.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Project 2: Blogging Platform</h3>
                <p>A platform for users to create and manage their blogs easily is one of my specialties. It is still in working progress though.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Project 3: E-commerce Site</h3>
                <p>Creating an online store with user authentication and payment processing is also something that earns good money. Iâ€™d definitely love to try that.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <h3>Testimonial</h3>
            <p>One of the things I have found to inspire me is my mom's saying. Whenever I feel pressured, she always says,"I know everything is ok, but I'm going to need you to do better. Leave it to Jehovah". Believe me, it always gets me back on my feet.</p>
